# Box

Box is the most abstract component on top of which all other Chakra UI
components are built. By default, it renders a `div` element

**The Box component is useful because it helps with 3 common use cases:**

- Create responsive layouts with ease.
- Provide a shorthand way to pass styles via props (`bg` instead of
  `backgroundColor`).
- Compose new component and allow for override using the `as` prop.

## Import

```js
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/core";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Box bg="tomato" w="100%" p={4} color="white">
  This is the Box
</Box>
```

### as prop

You can use the `as` prop to change the element render, just like
styled-components.

```jsx
<Box as="button" rounded="md" bg="tomato" color="white" px={4} h={8}>
  Button
</Box>
```
